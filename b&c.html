                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Richard Marcus, a notorious cheater in gambling history, used the "Savannah" method to remove chips from losing bets. He placed a small denomination chip on the roulette table, swapping the higher value chip for another $5 chip. 
                    If he won, he celebrated, causing the dealer to mistakenly assume he had staked two $5 chips. Marcus won thousands on winning bets and lost only a few dollars on losing bets.</p>

                <h2>Tommy Glenn Carmichael</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Carmichael, a successful slot machine cheater, developed a metal device that triggered payouts in 1980. As casinos updated their slots, he moved to smaller gambling establishments in Las Vegas. He developed the monkey paw or slider, 
                    which released coins from machines. He continued cheating until the advent of electronic slot games. He was arrested multiple times and sentenced to more prison time.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Ida Summers, known as the Vegas Vixen in the 1960s, used her beauty and charm to distract pit bosses and dealers in Las Vegas casinos. She worked blackjack tables using hand-mucking techniques 
                    and cold decks, or coolers, to ensure the house lost. Despite her success, Summers was eventually caught and arrested by gaming officials in Vegas and the FBI. Her appearance and charm may have 
                    had an effect in court, as she received probation rather than a custodial sentence, suggesting her looks and charm may have affected her case.</p>
