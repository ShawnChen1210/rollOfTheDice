                        How to play?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        In any game of classic Blackjack, Live Dealer Blackjack or online Blackjack, the underlying goal of the player is to come up with a hand that is higher than the dealer's hand and has a total sum that is close to, but not higher than 21.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Classic or American Blackjack is the game you’ll find in most casinos. You play this variation using a deck of 52 cards. Here, the blackjack win percentage or probability sits at 42.22%, while the chance of getting 21 is 4.75%.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="scenarioTitle">House Edge</h2>
                    <p>
                        The house edge is also known as the casino advantage. And it's something that exists on every table game, lotto, or slot in a casino online or on land. House edge tells you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Payouts: How much each game pays out on average over its lifespan.</li>
                            <li>Best returns: Which games offer players the best returns on their bets.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In blackjack (Assuming the player follows basic strategy) the house edge is anywhere between 0.5% to 1%. Meaning for every 100$ spent at the blackjack table the casino expects to keep 50c - 1$. This is one of the reasons why blackjack is so popular.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="scenarioTitle">Strategy</h2>
                    <p>Let's say the house currently has a queen of hearts and you are dealt the 6 of spades and the 7 of clubs leaving you with a total of 13. To calculate the percentage that you are going to bust, you have to calculate how many cards are over 8 in a single deck, then subtract that total by the amount of cards that are over 8 that are currently in play. In our scenario there are 23 cards that are over 8 and there is still 49 cards left in the pile, leaving us with a 47% chance of going over 21. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now let's calculate the chance of the dealer winning off of one hit. There are still 31 cards remaining that are between 7-11 and if we divide that by the 49 cards remaining will give us a 63.2% chance of the dealer winning in one hit.</p>
                    <p>You can use this strategy to calculate if it will be better off to hit on stand on this particular turn.</p>

                            <h3>12 vs Dealer 4</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the closest hands in blackjack when it comes to odds. And, honestly, it’s not a good position to be in.

                                When the dealer’s upcard is a 4, there’s a 40% chance they will bust. That means you’re going to lose the hand 60% of the time if you stand.
                                
                                If you choose to hit, your odds are slightly better, with a 58% chance of losing and a 2% chance of a push. Despite the slight advantage, our advice here is to stand and wait for the dealer to bust out.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <h3>15 vs Dealer 10</h3>
                            <p>This is one of the least favorable hands in all of blackjack. Whatever you do, the dealer has a much higher chance of winning.

                                Hitting will give you a 22% chance of victory. Choosing to stand, meanwhile, will give you the slightest of edges - a 23% chance of winning. You might as well take a risk and hit.
